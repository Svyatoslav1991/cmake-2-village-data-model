Use data structures to create a detailed village model.

There are many plots in the village, each has a unique number. At least one residential building must be located on each site, but other structures are also possible, such as a garage, a barn (change house) and a bathhouse. For each building, information is provided on the area that it occupies on the site.

A residential building can have 1-3 floors, each floor has 2-4 rooms: a bedroom, a kitchen, a bathroom, a nursery, a living room. For each room, data on the area is provided. For each floor, there is also data on the height of the ceiling. In a residential building and a bathhouse, there may be a stove with a pipe, information about this should also be provided in the data.

For all mentioned entities it is necessary to declare corresponding data structures.

At the beginning of the program, the user fills in the data about the village: enters the total number of plots and then begins to detail each plot.

For a site, the total number of buildings is first filled in, and then buildings, floors, rooms on floors are detailed.

As a result of the entered data, you can calculate the total parameter, for example, the percentage of land occupied by buildings to the total area of the entire village. The main thing in this task is not the calculation operation, but data structures.
